Based on the provided data, it is not possible to conclusively determine the gender of the individual since there are no clear indicators such as gendered names or professions. In general, during the 1800s and early 1900s, France did not have consistently gendered names or professions, and the head of household could be either male or female. Therefore, the most likely gender cannot be determined from the given information"
